## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have mostly worked in Stata, although I worked with R in my undergraduate degree. That was 4+ years ago. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel confident following instructions and guidance as a way to learn to code using R. That came pretty easily when I was learning Stata. I also feel confident working with others to troubleshoot. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I feel nervous about basically learning R from scratch. I know some folks in the class already have a foundation, so I am apprehensive about keeping up.
