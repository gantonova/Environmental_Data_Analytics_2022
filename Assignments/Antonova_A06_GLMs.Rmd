The completed exercise is due on Monday, February 28 at 7:00 pm.

## Set up your session 
1. Set up your session. Check your working directory. Load the tidyverse, agricolae and other needed packages. Import the *raw* NTL-LTER raw data file for chemistry/physics (`NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv`). Set date columns to date objects.

```{r}
#1

getwd()
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(agricolae)

 NTL_LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw <- read_csv("../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv")

 NTL_LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw$sampledate <- as.Date( NTL_LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

 class(NTL_LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw$sampledate)
```

2. Build a ggplot theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r setup}


#2 

mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
legend.position = "right")
theme_set(mytheme)
theme_get()


```

## Simple regression
Our first research question is: Does mean lake temperature recorded during July change with depth across all lakes?

3. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this question:
> Answer:
H0: mu = 0
Ha: mu != 0


4.  Wrangle your NTL-LTER dataset with a pipe function so that the records meet the following criteria: 
 * Only dates in July. 
 * Only the columns: `lakename`, `year4`, `daynum`, `depth`, `temperature_C`
 * Only complete cases (i.e., remove NAs)
 
```{r}
#4

library(lubridate)
NTL_LTER_subset <- 
  NTL_LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw %>%
  filter(month(sampledate) == 7) %>%
  select(lakename, year4, daynum, depth, temperature_C)%>%
  na.omit()
  


```


5. Visualize the relationship among the two continuous variables with a scatter plot of temperature by depth. Add a smoothed line showing the linear model, and limit temperature values from 0 to 35 Â°C. Make this plot look pretty and easy to read.

```{r scatterplot}


#5 
library(viridis)
NTL_LTER_scatterplot <- ggplot(NTL_LTER_subset, 
  aes(x = depth, y= temperature_C, color=temperature_C)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "magma")+
  ylim(0,35) +
  ylab("Temperature in Celsius") +
  xlab("Depth (m)") +
  labs(color = "Temperature")+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = TRUE, color = "blue")
  
print(NTL_LTER_scatterplot)


```


6. Interpret the figure. What does it suggest with regards to the response of temperature to depth? Do the distribution of points suggest about anything about the linearity of this trend?

> Answer: As depth increases, temperature decreases until you get to around 7 meters. Then, temperature stays relatively constant around 8 degrees Celsius. The relationship is not linear at that point. The relationship appears inverse.


7. Perform a linear regression to test the relationship and display the results

```{r linear.regression}
#7

DepthTempRegression <- lm(data=NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ depth)
summary(DepthTempRegression)
```


8. Interpret your model results in words. Include how much of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth, the degrees of freedom on which this finding is based, and the statistical significance of the result. Also mention how much temperature is predicted to change for every 1m change in depth. 

> Answer: For every one meter increase in depth, temperature decreseases 1.9 degrees Celsius. The model is statistically significant at the 0.01 level with a p-value less than 2.2e-16. 73.9% if the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth. These findings are based on 9726 degrees of freedom.

## Multiple regression
Let's tackle a similar question from a different approach. Here, we want to explore what might the best set of predictors for lake temperature in July across the monitoring period at the North Temperate Lakes LTER. 


9. Run an AIC to determine what set of explanatory variables (year4, daynum, depth) is best suited to predict temperature.

10. Run a multiple regression on the recommended set of variables. 

```{r temperature.model}
#9


NTLAIC <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ depth + 
              year4 + daynum)

#Choose a model by AIC in a Stepwise Algorithm
step(NTLAIC)
NTLmodel <- lm(data = NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ depth + 
    year4 + daynum)
summary(NTLmodel)



#10

DepthFullRegression <- lm(data=NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ depth, daynum, year4)
summary(DepthFullRegression)


```

11. What is the final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression? How much of the observed variance does this model explain? Is this an improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable?

> Answer: The final set of explanatory variables are depth, year4, and daynum. The model explains 71.6% of the observed variance which actually makes it a slightly worse model than only using depth as an explanatory variable.

## Analysis of Variance

12. Now we want to see whether the different lakes have, on average, different temperatures in the month of July. Run an ANOVA test to complete this analysis. (No need to test assumptions of normality or similar variances.) Create two sets of models: one expressed as an ANOVA models and another expressed as a linear model (as done in our lessons).

```{r anova.model}
#12


unique(NTL_LTER_subset$lakename)
LakesTempLinear <- lm(data=NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ lakename)

summary(LakesTempLinear)

LakesTempANOVA <- aov(data=NTL_LTER_subset, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(LakesTempANOVA)

```

13. Is there a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes? Report your findings. 

> Answer: Yes, there is a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes at the 0.01 level with p-value less than 2e-16. The ANOVA alone does not indicate which lakes have a statistically significant difference in mean temperature. 



14. Create a graph that depicts temperature by depth, with a separate color for each lake. Add a geom_smooth (method = "lm", se = FALSE) for each lake. Make your points 50 % transparent. Adjust your y axis limits to go from 0 to 35 degrees. Clean up your graph to make it pretty. 

```{r scatterplot.2}
#14.


LakeTempScatter <- ggplot(NTL_LTER_subset, aes(x=depth, y=temperature_C, color=lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)+
  ylim(0, 35)+
  ylab("Temperature in Celsius") +
  xlab("Depth (m)") +
  labs(color = "Lake Name")+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, color = "blue")


print(LakeTempScatter)



```

15. Use the Tukey's HSD test to determine which lakes have different means.

```{r tukey.test}
#15
TukeyHSD(LakesTempANOVA)

LakesMeanDifferences <- HSD.test(LakesTempANOVA, "lakename", group = TRUE)

LakesMeanDifferences

```

16.From the findings above, which lakes have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake? Does any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes?

>Answer:

Paul and Ward Lakes have the same mean temperature to Peter Lake, statistically speaking. No lake has a statistically distinct temperature from all the other lakes. 



17. If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake. What's another test we might explore to see whether they have distinct mean temperatures? 

>Answer: 

If we were just looking at Peter and Paul Lakes, we could use a t-test to explore whether they have distinct mean temperatures as an alternative method.
